# Documentation for testing class
The api contains a class that can be used for testing.
The class is `PerformanceTest.java` and it can be found in the `datastructureproject` packet.  

You can execute the class with a gradle task ´performanceTest´.  
**eg.** `./gradlew performanceTest`  
You can also pass parameters to the task and handle them in ´main´ method with ´args´ parameter.    
**eg.** `./gradlew performanceTest argument1 argument2 ... argumentn`  

**What you test and how you test it is entirely up to you.**
